Exquisite Corpse 

A method invented by the surrealists by which a collection of words or images is collectively assembled. Each collaborator adds to a composition in sequence. For this project you are constructing a creative narrative where each team member contributes a paragraph based on of what the previous person contributed. The design of the webpage is also a collaborative effort.
